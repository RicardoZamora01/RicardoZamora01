## Hi there 👋

My name is Ricardo Zamora (he/him). Born and raised in Oakland, CA, I decided to take a leap of faith and attend Wesleyan Univeristy in Connecticut. While at Wesleyan University, I decided to cofound the computer science club and the Latin American Student Organization. Wherever I go, I like to build a community with people with similar backgrounds or passions. In each respective club, I was able to recruit 100 members and led workshops, community events, and alumni talks. I have been a mentor and instructor during my time at Hack the Hood in 2021, and never hesitate to help out students who reach out for advice. 

### Current Role
* Fullstack Developer at Digital Service at Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services

### My Previous Roles
* Fullstack Software Engineer Intern @ Recidiviz
* Data Visualization Developer @ Wesleyan University
* Data Structures and Algorithms Student Instructor @ Wesleyan University
* Fullstack Software Engineer Intern @ Handshake
* Technical Instructor @ Hack the Hood
